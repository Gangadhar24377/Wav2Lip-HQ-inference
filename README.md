# Wav2Lip-HQ-inference

# Description
Wav2Lip-HQ Inference is a Python implementation of the Wav2Lip-HQ model, a lip-syncing system that generates high-quality talking-face videos. Given an input video of a person speaking and a target audio, this inference script uses the Wav2Lip-HQ model to generate a new video where the person's lips are synced to the provided audio. The model is trained to achieve high-quality lip-syncing results, making it suitable for various applications, including video dubbing, deep fakes, and more.

# Features
High-Quality Lip-Syncing: The Wav2Lip-HQ model produces lip-synced videos with realistic lip movements, delivering impressive results.

Real-Time Inference: The inference script efficiently generates lip-synced videos in real-time, making it convenient for rapid experimentation.

Custom Audio Input: Users can provide custom audio files to be synced with the input video, allowing for flexible use cases.

# Requirements
To run the Wav2Lip-HQ inference script, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.7 or higher
PyTorch
OpenCV
dlib
ffmpeg

# Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/your-username/wav2lip-hq-inference.git`
   
2. Install the required dependencies:
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   
3. Download the pre-trained Wav2Lip-HQ model weights:
   `wget -O wav2lip_hq.pth https://example.com/wav2lip_hq.pth`

# Usage
To generate a lip-synced video, follow these steps:

Prepare your input video (with a person speaking) and the target audio file.

Place the input video in the input_vids directory and the audio file in the audio_input directory.

Run the inference script:
`python inference.py --checkpoint_path wav2lip_hq.pth --face <input_video_filename> --audio <audio_filename> --outfile <output_filename>`

# Acknowledgments
This implementation is based on the original Wav2Lip-HQ repository. We acknowledge the authors for their valuable contributions to the lip-syncing research.

 Happy lip-syncing! üé§üìΩÔ∏è
